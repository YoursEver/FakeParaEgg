# FakeParaEgg
We created this microscopic image dataset to support the development of future copy-move forgery detection algorithms. 

This dataset was made from the public source data provided by the ICIP 2022 Challenge: Parasitic Egg Detection and Classification in Microscopic Images (https://icip2022challenge.piclab.ai/).
